# JavaScript Children's Story Builder Application

This project is a simple JavaScript project that allows users to build out a sentences with the displayed user interface. The application features options to build custom stories or randomly generate a sentence. I took inspiration from old children's storybook generation toys and built out a browser equivalent.
